Hello.
This is project which show ngrams statistics in Text.



It contains of:
  1. "main.py"(main file where all code is placed)
  2. "ui_design.py"(file with form created by "pyuic4" package with command " pyuic4 -x <file name>.ui -o  <new file name>.py ")
  3. "all_calculations.py"(file that contain some calculations like get "p" or "splitText")



Used modules and versions:
  - python '2.7.12'
  - PyQt4 '4.11.4'
  - matplotlib '1.5.1'

for building, please, use pyinstaller(for each platform it must be build separately).

To get this from git hub, use:
  1. clone from https://github.com/RosTanchak/reworked.git
  2. install modules (describe Above) via pip or other tools
  3. Have fun:
    a. To develop go to directory, than use python(check if this command run right version (python --version))
      "python main.py"
      Also if you want to add smth like button or change view of tab, then you need to install "pydesigner"  
    b. To execute as a user, go to ./dist and run "praktyka.exe"(if folder dist consist in other situation you need to build it or communicate with a person who can do it)













There are a lot of deprecated things or stuff that can be implemented in another way, Sorry for that. Will be glad to help in any way

  My email  is "suwuy123@gmail.com"

Have fun with it :(
